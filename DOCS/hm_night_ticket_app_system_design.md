# HM Night Event Ticket App - System Design

## Implementation approach

Based on the PRD requirements, we'll implement a responsive web application with a focus on beautiful UI, animations, and reliable QR code functionality. The system will be designed with mobile-first principles to ensure an optimal experience across all devices.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Backend**: Supabase for authentication, database, and storage
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **QR Code Generation**: qrcode.react library
- **QR Code Scanning**: react-qr-scanner
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Email**: SendGrid API integration

### Key Implementation Challenges

1. **QR Code Functionality**: Ensuring reliable generation and scanning of QR codes, with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms.

2. **Offline Support**: Implementing a reliable offline mode for the check-in process using service workers and IndexedDB for local storage.

3. **Responsive UI with Animations**: Creating a visually appealing interface that works across devices while maintaining performance.

4. **Real-time Updates**: Leveraging Supabase's real-time capabilities to ensure consistent data across multiple check-in devices.

5. **Email Integration**: Implementing secure and reliable email ticket delivery.

### Open Source Libraries

- **qrcode.react**: For generating QR codes on the client side
- **react-qr-scanner**: For QR code scanning using device camera
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth animations and transitions
- **react-hook-form**: For form validation and management
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive design and UI components
- **zustand**: For lightweight state management
- **supabase-js**: For Supabase integration
- **@sendgrid/mail**: For email ticket delivery

## Anything UNCLEAR

1. **Event-specific information**: The PRD doesn't specify what additional event information should be included beyond the basic student details. We've included fields for event name, date, time, and location, but these may need expansion.

2. **Email automation**: The design supports both automatic and manual email sending, but the preferred default behavior isn't specified in the PRD.

3. **User roles and permissions**: While the president and check-in staff roles are mentioned, specific permission levels aren't detailed. The current design assumes the president has full admin access.

4. **Multi-event capability**: The P2 requirement mentions multi-event support, but it's unclear if the initial version should have a foundation for this functionality.

5. **Ticket customization extent**: The level of customization for tickets (colors, logos, text) isn't fully specified.
